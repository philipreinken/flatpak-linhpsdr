## flatpak-linhpsdr

This is a [flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) manifest for building and running the
_awesome_ [LinHPSDR](https://github.com/g0orx/linhpsdr) software.

### Build

The build is implemented with [dagger.io](https://dagger.io).

For a list of possible tasks, checkout this repo and run

```bash
dagger functions
```

### Addendum

This project is not an official build or distribution of LinHPSDR and mainly a
learning exercise, so YMMV.
